      Since 2007, pixiv has built an online community for creators around the mantra “It’s fun drawing”. pixiv has since used Ruby on Rails to build pixiv.com (an international-focused version of pixiv.net) and pixiv comic (a site offering free online digital comics/manga). Engineers all around the world have adopted Ruby - not just because Ruby is a superior language, but because of the immensely attractive community behind it. Just as the art on pixiv transcends language, so too does the Ruby community. We will continue to support the creators of the world, regardless of medium - code or canvas.
