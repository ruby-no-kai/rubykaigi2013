- title: Show Your Opensource Activities w/ ScreenX TV
  description: |-
    Knowing WHAT you code is easy; just check your GitHub account, but
    knowing HOW you code is still difficult. So, we made ScreenX TV, an opensource
    terminal broadcasting tool, which lets you easily broadcast your terminal to the
    world.

    In this lightning talk, you'll learn how to broadcast, how it works,
    and how it's used by terminal broadcasters. ScreenX TV http://screenx.tv/

- title: Using flash cards to know Ruby better
  description: When it comes to memorizing the innards of a programming language in
    order to understand it better, nothing beats flash cards with spaced repetition
    in my experience. This presentation will show you how you can apply the same technique
    to make sure you remember everything you want to remember about Ruby (or anything
    else for that matter).

- title: a test code generator for RSpec users
  description: "rspec-kickstarter is a test code generator for RSpec users. \n\n[https://github.com/seratch/rspec-kickstarter](https://github.com/seratch/rspec-kickstarter)\n\nTDD
    is a very useful approach but actually many projects are not fully TDD-based and
    we sometimes need to face apps that don't have enough coverage. In such a situation,
    I believe that this tool is especially useful.\n\nIt's easy to say \"You should
    write tests for the legacy code before modifying it\" but it's not always easy
    to keep the motivation to do the right thing because developers have many things
    to do before they start writing essential parts of test. It's messy to create
    a new file or figure out the existing spec file, find out what the lacking test
    cases are and write routine stuff which starts with 'describe'.\n\nrspec-kickstarteer
    enables developers writing test immediately. If the spec is absent, it generates
    a new spec template file. Furthermore, it appends lacking test cases (with TODO
    comments) to existing the spec file if they're found. \n\nI know that testing
    for methods is not perfect but it's pretty important to reduce the psychological
    barrier. \n\nI'll show some examples about rspec-kickstarter in this talk."

- title: Challenges building a call center with 3rd party APIs
  description: |-
    Even with the help of third party APIs (Twilio, Tropo, Adhersion, etc.) that provide
    telephony functionality, there are mayor design challenges involved when building a
    call center.

    But thanks to the ruby community and the availability of incredible gems and libraries
    this task is now simple enough that just a few developers can build and replicate
    full feature telephony systems.

    I will introduce my static analysis tool called FlawDetector.
    It analyzes RubyVM bytecode and detects some "flaws" in ruby code.
    "flaws" means some bugs and redundant code,  which is similer to  bug pattern of FindBugs - a statyc anlaysis tool of java bytecode.
    I with you use FlawDetector and improve it with me.

- title: A case study on exporting local culture with Rails application
  description: |-
    Rails helps people understand new idea, we know.

    There are many interesting local cultures in the world, but it is difficult to introduce such cultures to other people. Rails application can reduce such difficulty using some tips.

    Our experience is introduction of Japanese 'Kukai' to French students. Kukai is a game to enjoy Haiku, short Japanese poetry. In Kukai, attendees score each Haikus and comments by each other. We developed a Kukai Rails application and this system used by a lecture at a French school. The lecture was well-received. To develop our Kukai system, Internationalisation (i18n) is easy to support using Rails framework.

    In this talk, we show our experience and key points of transferring one local culture to other cultures using Rails web application.
