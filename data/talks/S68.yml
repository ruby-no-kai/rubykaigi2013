title: Paired ruby
description: Pair programming shares a similar philosophy with Ruby- the focus is
  on  people solving problems for other people, not the machine. I want to share my
  experiences with pair programming and how it helped me become a better engineer,
  enjoy coding more, and maybe even grow as a person.
