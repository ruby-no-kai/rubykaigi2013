title: 'Webruby: Now you can write your favorite Ruby code for the browser!'
description: Webruby uses emscripten to compile mruby, the lightweight Ruby implementation
  into pure JavaScript. This allows programmers to write Ruby code and run it in the
  browser. What's more, we also built a JavaScript calling interface from Webruby,
  and an OpenGL ES 2.0 binding. While naturally suited for building Web-based games,
  Webruby also provides an alternative for modern single-page applications without
  using JavaScript.

  bio: Despite an experience of writing G-BASIC on NES-compatible systems in primary
    school, my programming life really starts when I got a Chinese version of SICP.
    As a Lisp fan, I found much joy playing with Ruby later and fell in love with
    it:)
