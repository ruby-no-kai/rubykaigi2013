title: From Rails to the web server to the browser
description: |-
  Most of us know how to build beautiful web applications with Rails. With the help of templating tools like ERB and HAML our web apps create HTML documents, but, do you know exactly how those HTML documents end up in a browser?

  During this talk I will show you the bits that make it all happen. We will dissect the relevant code within Rails, Rack and the thin web server to discover exactly how the web server starts and listens to a TCP port, communicates with Rails and returns the HTML document that your browser parses.

  Why? Because we're curious about it, that's why.
