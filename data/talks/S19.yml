  Ruby is famous for a technique called metaprogramming.  This technique can be
  used for good, or for eval.  In this talk, we'll explore ways to leverage
  metaprogramming, as well as how to deal with code that is out of control.
  We'll use examples of Metaprogramming Gone Bad to study techniques for dealing
  with legacy code, and discovering the most effective way to harness the power
  of code generation without the maintenance nightmare

  bio: |-
    Aaron was born and raised on the mean streets of Salt Lake City.  His only hope
    for survival was to join the local gang of undercover street ballet performers
    known as the Tender Tights.  As a Tender Tights member, Aaron learned to
    perfect the technique of self-defense pirouettes so that nobody, not even the
    Parkour Posse could catch him.  Between vicious street dance-offs, Aaron taught
    himself to program.  He learned to combine the art of street ballet with the
    craft of software engineering.  Using these unique skills, he was able to leave
    his life on the streets and become a professional software engineer.  He is
    currently Pirouetting through Processes, and Couruing through code for AT&T.
    Sometimes he thinks back fondly on his life in the Tender Tights, but then he
    remembers that it is better to have Tender Loved and Lost than to never have
    Tender Taught at all.
