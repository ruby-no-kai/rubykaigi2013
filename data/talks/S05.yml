title: Identical Production, Staging and Development Environments Using Chef, AWS
  and Vagrant
description: |-
  Learn how Engine Yard uses Amazon Web Services and Chef to bring up any number of servers ranging from a solo instance to a cluster of instances with multiple app instances, database instances and utility instances for memcached, resque, sphinx, and everything your app needs.

  Snapshots are used to create a clone of your production environment where you can test all the changes before making them in production.

  Vagrant and VirtualBox are used to provide a development environment with the same OS you use in production. Chef is used to install the same packages. In fact you use the same chef recipes everywhere.
