title: You have to test multiple versions of your gem's dependencies. You used Appraisal.
  It's super affective!
description: So, it seems like you've finished writing your awesome gem. However,
  are you sure that your gem is working perfectly against multiple versions of its
  dependency? Are you sure that you didn't break any backward compatibility? In this
  talk, I'm going to show you the approach we have been taken to test our gems against
  multiple versions of dependencies, such as testing against Rails 3.2 and Rails 3.1.
  I'm also going to introduce you to our gem called "Appraisal" which helps you generating
  Gemfiles to be used with Bundler, and also guide it to running your test suite against
  those multiple Gemfiles. Lastly, I'm going to show you how you can config Travis
  CI to test your gem against those multiple versions of dependencies.
