title: Shrink to Grow
description: |-
  Ruby has grown in the last 20 years. The feature-set and field of usage has increased. But also the code-size has reached an exceptional size. For many systems Ruby is nowadays to large.

  To reach new systems we have to re-think the way we implement Ruby. We have to shrink Ruby to be able to grow into a new field with an army of small devices.

  This talk will cover the development of mruby. The current state of the implementation and the reason why you should contribute to it.
