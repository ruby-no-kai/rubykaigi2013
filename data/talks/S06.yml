title: Fewer Constraints, More Concurrency.
description: Traditional data structures like stacks and queues are strict - perhaps
  too strict. In this talk I will showcase some classical data structures and then
  provide alternative constraints that will allow our algorithms to achieve a greater
  level of concurrency. Examples will include a mix of Ruby and Postgres.
