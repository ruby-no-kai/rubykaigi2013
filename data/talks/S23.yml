title: 'Torquebox: When Java Became Cool Again'
description: |-
  An introduction to Torquebox (http://torquebox.org/), a JRuby Application Server, which bridges between Ruby's clean DSLs and Java's robust libraries to provide high-speed and reliable caching, messaging, background tasks and more in a single deployment.

  If you're tired of installing a bunch of projects (web server, memcache, redis, messaging, etc) just to run a single app, Torquebox is for you.

  bio: While I work primarily as a frontend developer these days, my heart has always
    been with Ruby. I created and run Middleman, a popular ruby-based static website
    generator and use Ruby for all my personal project. You can catch me complaining
    about Javascript on twitter, most days.
