title: "TWO CARTOON FOXES: the _why documentary (Japanese Subtitled)"
description: |-
  In this short documentary film, we explore Ruby's beloved and mysterious character Why the Lucky Stiff (_why). Matz created Ruby and _why created his (poignant) Guide to Ruby, with musical soundtrack, to spread the Ruby love to people outside the Land of the Rising Sun. This documentary celebrates _why's art and features interviews with TenderLove, MeNTaLguY, Steve Klabnik, Flip, Geoffrey Grosenbach, and Matz. And rabbits and cartoon foxes.
