  bio: |
    Working on distributed systems for 5 years, including C, C++, Erlang and Ruby.
    Had been wasted his life for memory management, multi-threading, native code compilation
    and segmentation fault. Erlang and LL is best combination for his life -
    solid but hard language for backend middleware, like Erlang
    and flexible and comprehensive language for frontend, like Ruby or Python.
    In Japan it is not so popular, but Basho is heavy user of Ruby,
    and thus HE IS trying to be Rubyist.
