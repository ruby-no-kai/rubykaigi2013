title: Live Coding with Ben
description: "This speaker believes that the best way for programmers to learn is
  to watch each other work. \n\nThis talk leaves slides behind and focuses instead
  on the greater information density achieved through live coding.\n\nWe'll discuss
  the strengths and weaknesses of real code, and refactor it right on-stage. As we
  do so, we'll bump into lots of meaty topics:\n\n* Potential downfalls of the 'extract
  module' refactoring (aka ActiveSupport::Concern).\n* The pros and cons of Dependency
  Injection.\n* How two good OO design ideas (like SRP and Tell Don't Ask) can contradict
  each other, and what to do about it.\n* How well-placed functional programming can
  improve a codebase.\n* Whether the Law of Demeter should be followed religiously,
  and what it means if that's hard to do.\n* Why fast tests are usually good tests,
  and vice-versa.\n\nAudience participation is strongly encouraged, as is stealing
  the speaker's vim tricks for your own use. "
