title: Rapid development of enterprise web apps with Netzke
description: Netzke is a library that allows creating full-featured client-server
  GUI components - such as data grids, forms, windows, trees, etc - which then can
  be easily used as building blocks for complex enterprise applications. It uses Ruby
  on Rails at the server-side, and Sencha Ext JS in the browser. The choice of Ext
  JS provides for consistent look and feel, as well as for painless reusability of
  third-party Netzke components. Most importantly, Netzke allows for writing clean
  and highly maintainable code, which almost doesn't grow with the number of data
  models being used. After a brief introduction to the basics of Netzke design, a
  live coding session will be held to show how to build an example of a fairly complex
  back-end application with Netzke - by almost exclusively writing Ruby code.
