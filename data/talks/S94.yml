title: Be a library developer!
description: |
  Is there a gem author around you? Did you meet any author of the gems
  used? Did you contact with any author of the gems used on the
  Internet?

  Do you think that "the author is cool!", "the author is awesome!" or
  "I respect the author!"? Do you want to be a gem author?

  This talk doesn't describe about how to create a gem because it is
  easy. "gem" is a package of Ruby library (, tool and so on) for easy
  to install. This talk describes about developing a library that is gem
  content.

  This talk is based on my experience as a library developer. This talk
  describes about how to write codes, how to write documents, release,
  support and mental set for a better "library developer". I hope that
  this talk is a trigger for increasing the number of better "library
  developers".
